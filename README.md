# MNIST Neural Network from Scratch

This is a simple neural network project made from scratch using only **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
The project trains a neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the **MNIST dataset**.

---

## Features
- Neural network with 1 hidden layer.
- Implemented **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **gradient descent** manually.
- Uses **ReLU** and **Softmax** activation functions.
- Can test predictions and show digit images.
- Achieves decent accuracy (~85%) on MNIST data.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Kaggle MNIST Digit Recognizer dataset**.  
You can download it from: [Kaggle Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data)

- `train.csv` → Training data (used in this project)  
- `test.csv` → Test data (not used here, but can be added)
